            <h2>Why Use Halal Kitchen?</h2>
            <p>
              Halal Kitchen is the easiest way to make any recipe halal-compliant. 
              Whether you're cooking for your family, running a halal restaurant, or 
              exploring Islamic dietary guidelines, our converter provides instant 
              halal substitutions with confidence scores.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Instant Conversion:</strong> Paste any recipe and get halal-compliant results in seconds</li>
              <li><strong>Halal Substitutes:</strong> Automatic ingredient replacements with Islamic references</li>
              <li><strong>Confidence Scores:</strong> Know how confident we are in each conversion</li>
              <li><strong>Quick Lookup:</strong> Check if individual ingredients are halal before cooking</li>
              <li><strong>Community Tips:</strong> Learn from other users' substitution experiences</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>
              Our AI-powered converter analyzes your recipe ingredients and identifies 
              non-halal items like pork, alcohol, and non-halal gelatin. We then suggest 
              halal alternatives that maintain flavor and texture, backed by Qur'anic and 
              Hadith references.

            <h2 id="guide-heading">Practical guide: halal cooking at home</h2>
            <p>
              Eating halal is not only about avoiding a short list of ingredients—it is about building habits:
              reading labels carefully, knowing when an ingredient&apos;s <em>source</em> matters (for example
              gelatin or enzymes), and choosing suppliers you trust. Halal Kitchen exists to speed up that
              work: we highlight common problems in a recipe, suggest swaps, and point you to references so
              you can decide with confidence.
            </p>
            <h3>Why &quot;questionable&quot; ingredients need context</h3>
            <p>
              Some items are halal or haram depending on how they were made. Gelatin might come from fish,
              beef, or pork. Vanilla extract may contain alcohol as a solvent. Rennet in cheese can be
              animal-derived or microbial. A generic recipe that says &quot;gelatin&quot; or &quot;natural flavors&quot;
              does not tell you the source—so a good halal workflow is: identify the ambiguous line, check
              the product label or manufacturer, and substitute when in doubt (for example agar-agar instead
              of unknown gelatin).
            </p>
            <h3>Reading packaged food labels</h3>
            <p>
              Start with the ingredient list, not only the marketing on the front. Look for alcohol in any
              form (wine, beer, ethyl alcohol, &quot;natural flavor&quot; carriers in some products), pork or lard,
              and non-halal animal derivatives. If a product carries a recognized halal certification mark
              for your market, that can reduce guesswork—but certification standards differ by country and
              body, so many families still prefer to read ingredients for themselves.
            </p>
            <h3>Restaurants, shared kitchens, and cross-contact</h3>
            <p>
              At home you control pans, oils, and grills. In restaurants or industrial kitchens, cross-contact
              with non-halal meat or alcohol may occur. Our converter focuses on <strong>ingredient lists in
              recipes</strong>; it does not certify a kitchen or supply chain. When eating out, ask how food is
              prepared if you follow strict separation.
            </p>

            <h2 id="faq-heading">Frequently asked questions</h2>
            <dl className="seo-faq-list">
              <dt>Is Halal Kitchen a fatwa or legal authority?</dt>
              <dd>
                No. We provide educational tools and automated suggestions. For personal rulings on edge cases,
                consult a qualified scholar you trust.
              </dd>
              <dt>Does the recipe converter work for any cuisine?</dt>
              <dd>
                You can paste recipes from any tradition. The tool flags common haram or doubtful ingredients
                and suggests halal-friendly replacements; you should still verify packaged products yourself.
              </dd>
              <dt>Can I scan an ingredient label with my phone?</dt>
              <dd>
                Yes—open the app, use &quot;Scan ingredients&quot; under the recipe box, and capture or upload a clear
                photo of the ingredient list. Results depend on photo quality and OCR.
              </dd>
              <dt>What does the confidence score mean?</dt>
              <dd>
                It reflects how strongly our rules match the ingredients we detected—lower scores often mean
                more substitutions or more items that need manual verification.
              </dd>
              <dt>How do you make money?</dt>
              <dd>

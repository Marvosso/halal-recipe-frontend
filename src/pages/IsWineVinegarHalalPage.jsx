          rulingSummary="Wine vinegar is halal (permissible) in Islam. The fermentation process completely transforms alcohol into acetic acid, eliminating all intoxicating properties. This is supported by authentic hadith where the Prophet (peace be upon him) approved of vinegar made from wine."
          whyExplanation="Wine vinegar is made through a two-step fermentation process: first, wine is made from grapes (which contains alcohol), then acetic acid bacteria convert the alcohol into acetic acid, creating vinegar. The key Islamic principle here is transformation (istihalah) - when a haram substance undergoes a complete chemical transformation, it may become halal. Most scholars agree that once wine fully transforms into vinegar, it loses its intoxicating properties and becomes halal. This is supported by a hadith where the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about vinegar made from wine, and he approved of it. However, some scholars recommend using alternatives to avoid any doubt, especially if the vinegar still contains trace amounts of alcohol."
